-Fetch has an SRDF in moveit_config/config but it also requires a URDF
-URDF in fetch_description/robots
-launch file that uses SRDF and URDF is in moveit_config/launch and is called planning_context.launch
-fetch_description also has a folder with meshes for fetch and freight
-links with helpful info on srdf and urdf:
	-http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/62/sdf-vs-urdf-what-should-one-use/
	-http://wiki.ros.org/srdf

-kinematics.yaml arguments:
	-kinematics_solver: tells you which kinematics solver to use
	-kinematics_solver_search_resolution: specifies the resolution that a solver might use to search over the redundant space for inverse kinematics
	-kinematics_solver_timeout: default timeout specified for each internal iteration that the inverse kinematics solver may perform
	-kinematics_solver_attempts: the number of random restarts that will be performed on the solver
-can find kdl code at: https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics
-in moveit_ros_move_group you can find default_capabilities_plugin_description.xml you can find lots of capabilities that are loaded for the Move Group
-perhaps use IKFast (better for lower dof arms so maybe not-does not work with greater than 7dof)

Next time: look into KDLKinematicsPlugin and figure out if its a good thing to use-also figure out how to use it independently from MoveIt
